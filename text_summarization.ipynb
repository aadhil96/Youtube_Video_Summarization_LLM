I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely  damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. T he villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.
